                    Hi, I'm Kyle Krick! I'm a problem solver, and while I usually use code to solve problems I do have more skills to
                    offer like clear communication, professional writing and collaborative teamwork. While I really enjoy web development, I also
                    have experience in scripting, information security, and game development. Some of the technologies I'm experienced with include: 
                    HTML, CSS, JS, SharePoint, Azure, PowerShell, Java and C.

                    When I'm not programming, I'm likely to be found serving in my church (Skyline of Rancho San Diego), helping out my family, 
                    learning a new language at home, hanging out with friends, playing videogames or making electronice dance music (EDM).
